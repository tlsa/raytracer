A very simple ray tracer
========================

This a simple ray tracer based on an
[eight line(!) BBC BASIC program](https://twitter.com/bbcmicrobot/status/1464553737255596036)
by Steve McCrea and Adam Foster.

I rewrote it in C with the aim of understanding how it worked, and making
no attempt to retain the small size.
